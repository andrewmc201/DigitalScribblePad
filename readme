Digital Scribble Pad lets you log in as a temporary user and store notes for a short period of time. 
It is not intended to be a long-term storage system, instead operating on the same principle as Mailinator.
Notes are limited to 1024 characters per note maximum.

Api routes:
'/api/notes/user/:userId' : GET[userId : (desired user id)]
'/api/notes' : POST[body: {userId : (desired user id), note: (desired note text)}]
'/api/notes/:noteId' : GET[noteId : (desired note id)], PUT[noteId : (desired note id), note: (desired body for note)], DELETE[noteId : (desired note id to delete)]

'/api/users' : POST[username : (the username you want to use to create a new user)]
